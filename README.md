# 🍕 Pizza Sales Data Analysis Project – MySQL & Power BI

## 📌 Overview
This project involves analyzing a pizza sales dataset using **MySQL** for data cleaning and querying, followed by building an interactive dashboard in **Power BI**. The goal was to extract meaningful insights related to sales, customer demand, and product performance.

## 🗂️ Dataset Structure
The dataset consists of the following CSV tables:

- `orders.csv` – contains order ID, date/time
- `order_details.csv` – links orders to pizzas, includes quantity
- `pizzas.csv` – includes pizza ID, size, and price
- `pizza_types.csv` – includes name, category (classic, veggie, etc.)

## 🧠 Key Objectives
- Analyze total revenue and order volume
- Identify top-performing pizzas by revenue and quantity
- Understand customer ordering behavior over time
- Compare performance across pizza categories and sizes

## 🛠 SQL Tasks Performed
Using **MySQL**, I performed:

- Data cleaning (`TRIM`, `LOWER`, handling nulls)
- Joins across 4 tables (`INNER JOIN`)
- Aggregations (`SUM`, `COUNT`, `AVG`)
- Date operations using `DATE_FORMAT()`, `MONTH()`, etc.
- Subqueries for top 5 pizza sales
- `CASE WHEN` for category-based grouping
